This is a replication of the paper [Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588), as well as additional experiments expanding the work of the paper, on which we get results similar to the paper.

This project was done in collaboration with Anthony Duong. It was started as the capstone project of the ARENA bootcamp and continued after the end of the bootcamp.
